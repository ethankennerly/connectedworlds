Inspired by conversation with Matt and Diana at http://themade.org

Post-mortem

What went right:
+ Memorizing:  Dots to connect is surprisingly challenging even at your own pace.
+ No words:  Matt suggested connect the dots and Diana had ideas about constellations.  Jennifer and Beth also playtested, which clarified the tutorial.  No words needed to play.
+ Drawing:  Exported Flash drawings to Adobe Illustrator format and wrote a Python script to parse them into a JSON-like object.  Clean separation of model and view.

What went wrong:
- A bug that showed another drawing after the end of the game cost hours.
- Wasn't satisfied with 8-bit sounds, so didn't add sounds post-compo version.
- Dots were too exact until post-compo version.
- Wasn't clear about a scoring system until the post-compo version.
